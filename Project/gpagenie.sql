(2, 'GPA and Financial Aid: How your Grades Affect your Student Loans', 'gpa-financial-aid', 'Are you at risk of losing your financial aid due to poor academic performance? We\'ll go over the steps you need to take to keep your student loans in place.\r\nOne of the most confusing parts of the higher ed process is applying for and receiving financial aid. When filling out a financial aid application, we usually focus on what it takes to get the\r\nmoney, not to keep it.\r\nWhen speaking to your academic advisor, make sure to ask questions about your college GPA and how failing or dropping a course could cause you to lose your financial aid.\r\nMost students know very little about the role their college GPA plays in keeping them funded while in school. Although the guidelines often vary slightly from school to school, we have put together some general information to use as a \"rule of thumb.\"\r\n<h3><strong>What is SAP?</strong></h3>\r\nBefore starting college, Macie knew of \"sap\" as something sticky that falls from trees.\r\nIn college, SAP is an acronym that stands for satisfactory academic progress, and it has nothing to do with plant survival.\r\nIt does, however, relate to school survival. This is something Macie found out the hard way.\r\nFederal financial aid, including Pell grants and other certain loans, requires that students make satisfactory academic progress while enrolled in school in order to keep their funding.\r\nUsually, this means maintaining a 2.0 college grade point average.\r\nA 2.0 GPA is a \"C\" average and isn\'t ideal, but it is typically good enough to keep the cash flowing for undergraduate students.\r\nFor those in graduate programs, the bar is often set much higher.\r\nUsually, grad students must maintain a 3.0 or higher.\r\nWhich brings us back to Macie, who made two Ds during her first semester and was shocked to learn that her financial aid was in jeopardy.\r\nAfter all, a D isn\'t a failing grade. What she didn\'t consider is that D\'s can tank her overall GPA.\r\nThis is why it\'s so important to use a financial aid calculator to keep track of where you are.\r\n<h3><strong>What Happens if My Grades Drop?</strong></h3>\r\nIf your cumulative grade point average dips below a 2.0, you will no longer be considered to be in good academic standing.\r\nIf this is the case for you, it\'s likely that you have been (or will be) placed on academic probation.\r\nThis is a \"watch period\" in which financial aid is not usually lost.\r\nIf this is where you are in the process, don\'t be afraid to reach out to your academic advisor for help.\r\nMany schools have \"fresh start\" programs and success coaches that can assist students who are having trouble with keeping up their grade point average.\r\nOnce you have made it through another semester and raised your GPA, your probationary status should lift.\r\nHowever, if you fail to improve your grades to a satisfactory number, you will be at risk of being given a \'warning\' which can affect the funding you receive.\r\nThe third semester with a not so great GPA equals not only losing your financial aid but also being suspended or dismissed from school altogether.\r\nDid you know that if you fail a class that financial aid paid for, this could create a balance on your account?\r\nThis could result in you being responsible for paying the school back the course cost.\r\nOf course, grant and loan types vary, as do the consequences for poor performance.\r\nFor this reason, you should make sure that you understand all of the warning periods associated with your particular aid type.\r\n<h3><strong>What If I Fail a Class?</strong></h3>\r\nThere is a second way that your financial aid can be affected by course GPA and this is when you actually fail a class.\r\nIf you\'ve received an F, most schools review your participation to see if you failed because you struggled with the content or if you simply didn\'t try.\r\nIf you participated less than 60% of the time (percentage may vary by school,) you could be at risk of owing your college the cost of the course.\r\nThis means that even if you have a GPA that is high enough to withstand one \"F-bomb,\" you could still lose your financial aid.\r\nFor this reason, it\'s usually better to drop a class early on than to stop participating and take a failing grade.\r\n<h3><strong>What Can I Do?</strong></h3>\r\nIf you are worried about losing your financial aid because of problems with academic performance, now is not the time to bury your head in the sand.\r\nLike Macie from above, you will need to be proactive and explore all options for retaining satisfactory academic progress.\r\nAfter talking to her guidance counselor, she was able to get pinpoint some of the obstacles that caused her to do poorly the first go-round.\r\nBy cutting back her hours at her part-time job and hiring a tutor, Macie was able to pass the following semester with honors.\r\nOther best practices include:\r\n<h4><strong>Do your homework (literally and figuratively).</strong></h4>\r\nCall or email your academic advisor and ask them for specifics on your school\'s rules regarding GPA and financial aid.\r\nAsk questions about how often your progress will be evaluated, how incomplete classes will affect you, and what will happen if you fall below SAP levels.\r\nThen, work as hard as you can to make sure that you meet the minimum requirements needed to avoid suspension and/or loss of funding.\r\n<h4><strong>Come up with a game plan.</strong></h4>\r\nOnce you know how high of a bar your school has set for you, you\'ll be able to come up with a plan for academic success.\r\nAs simple as it seems, the act of writing down each step you plan can be the difference between failure and success.\r\nTake some time to think about actionable steps to improve your academic standing.\r\nThis might include meeting with a guidance counselor, finding a tutor, or taking part in a college readiness course.\r\n<h4><strong>Appeal if needed.</strong></h4>\r\nIf your less-than-stellar college GPA is due to extenuating circumstances, you can try to appeal.\r\nJust like GPA requirements, every university\'s appeal process varies. However, there are certain situations like being called away to serve in the military or a serious illness that can help you qualify for another shot.\r\nIf you\'re at risk of losing your financial assistance because of your academic performance, do not be afraid to reach out for help.\r\nA mistake that many students make is being too ashamed to share with anyone.\r\nThis creates a cycle of failure that often leads to academic suspension.\r\nIt\'s never too late to turn things around.\r\nReread the bullets above and then reach out to your advisor for guidance.\r\nHe or she is one of your best sources of support when it comes to academic success and will be glad to be in your corner.', 'Student loans often depend on a 2.0 GPA minimum.

(3, 'Can I Round-Up my GPA?', 'round-up-gpa', 'Is rounding up your GPA allowed? Surprisingly the answer can be yes. We\'ll walk through the scenarios when this practice is acceptable and when it isn\'t.\r\nLet\'s face it: your GPA is seen as a reflection of your educational effort and overall work ethic. This makes it an important part of career growth (like it or not.)\r\nA high grade point average is an accomplishment that many new grads\r\nuse to impress potential employers. The same is true for students applying for scholarships or wanting to be accepted into a certain school.\r\nMany students who are looking for a competitive edge in their field consider rounding up their overall GPA to a higher number before adding it to a resume or job application. But should you do it?\r\nA common question that comes up during all of these scenarios is whether or not it\'s okay to round up one\'s GPA.\r\nIt might be tempting to use a GPA calculator and then bump the number a little bit.\r\nAfter all, a 3.0 GPA sounds a lot better than 2.95.\r\nThis is especially important to students trying to meet a certain minimum GPA requirement.\r\nBut is GPA conversion ethical?\r\n<h3><strong>Rounding Up Your GPA</strong></h3>\r\nA high GPA alone probably won\'t get you a job, but it can be the deciding factor between being given (or not given) an interview.\r\nIf you\'re wanting to land a job and are thinking of rounding up your GPA to provide yourself with an edge, you can proceed--but with caution.\r\nHere are some general rules when it comes to GPA conversion:\r\n<h4><strong>Rounding up to the nearest tenth is acceptable.</strong></h4>\r\n(3.68 = 3.7) but not to the nearest whole number. A 2.78 GPA does not round up to a 3.0.\r\n<h4><strong>Claiming a 4.0 you haven\'t earned is a no-no.</strong></h4>\r\nIf you have a 3.92 and are wanting to convert to a 4.0, reconsider.\r\nBecause achieving a 4.0 GPA is such a distinguished accomplishment, many career and resume experts advise against rounding in this situation.\r\n<h4><strong>Avoiding GPA to letter grade conversion is advised.</strong></h4>\r\nChanging a 2.95 into a 3.0 might seem like a minor change but it actually alters the letter grade from a C to a B. This is a misrepresentation that could cost you a program spot or job if discovered.\r\n<h4><strong>Listing your true GPA is your best bet in some situations.</strong></h4>\r\nFor example, if you are filling out an online application that has two spots after the decimal, you should include all three numbers (3.92 instead of a 3.9).\r\n<h4><strong>Applying for a competitive position.</strong></h4>\r\nWhen you know that transcripts are likely to be checked is a hard rounding \"don\'t.\"\r\nErr on the side of caution and avoid rounding up your grade point average in instances where you know it will be double-checked or questioned.\r\nAchieving a 4.0 GPA is a distinguished accomplishment and considered \"perfect\" by many institutions.\r\nFor this reason, you should never round up to reach a 4.0 GPA on a resume or college application.\r\n<h3><strong>Proceed with Caution</strong></h3>\r\nBeing able to do something doesn\'t mean that you should.\r\nThink of it this way: you could go buy an extra-large pizza right now and eat the entire thing by yourself.\r\nBut the aftermath would probably make you regret that decision.\r\nAlthough bumping up your GPA might secure your place in the candidate pool, there is always the chance that someone could catch the discrepancy between the GPA you rounded up and the one on your actual transcripts.\r\nThis could make you look dishonest or untrustworthy, which is why it is important to recognize the risk.\r\n<h3><strong>Consider Other Options</strong></h3>\r\nThere are other things you can do to stand out during the application process if you decide rounding up your GPA isn\'t right for you.\r\nThese include:\r\n- Listing the GPA for your major instead of your overall grade point average (a GPA calculator can help with this)', 'Can you legally round your GPA up?

(4, 'GPA and First Jobs', 'gpa-first-jobs', 'How much does GPA matter when looking for your first job? We\'ll walk through how to use your grades during a job search, regardless of where you\'re at.\r\nIf you\'re like most college grads, you\'re officially on the hunt for your first postgrad job. You\'re putting the final touches on your resume, getting started on cover letters, and maybe even\r\npracticing tough interview questions so you can land the perfect gig.\r\nBut now that you\'re officially no longer a student, what about your grades? How much does your GPA really matter in the job search process?\r\nWhile you may no longer be a student, your grades still count. Recruiters may want to see your final GPA on your resume, especially if you\'re applying for a highly competitive job.\r\nWe\'ll walk through the answers to these questions and outline best practices for using your GPA when applying for your first job.\r\n<h3><strong>Does my college GPA matter?</strong></h3>\r\nYour college GPA matters to employers (sometimes).\r\nWe know this isn\'t the straightforward answer that you were hoping for, but hear us out.\r\nA GPA of 3.0 or higher is usually preferred by most companies that hire entry-level candidates because it shows a real commitment to academic success.\r\nEmployers tend to value the following qualities:<br>\r\n- A strong work ethic<br>\r\n- Dependability and responsibility<br>\r\n- Self-motivation<br>\r\nAnd recruiters view strong grades as a by-product of these qualities.\r\nAlso, GPA is regularly used as a first step in shuffling through job candidates, especially for highly competitive positions.\r\nIn fact, research has shown that hiring managers only spend about 7 seconds reviewing a resume before moving on to the next candidate.\r\nAnd your grade point average is usually one of the first things they look at to determine whether or not you\'ll move on to the next step.\r\nThis is especially true for jobs in finance, accounting, tech, and engineering since new grads often flock to these fields.\r\nHaving a GPA of 3.5 or higher is always an asset here.\r\nBut even if you\'re applying for something outside of these categories, your grades can help get you noticed.\r\n<h3><strong>Should I put my GPA on my resume?</strong></h3>\r\nThe answer to this question depends on two things: how much work experience you have and how high of a GPA you earned.\r\nIf you\'re entry level in your field or recently graduated, you should make sure and have this information visible for hiring managers.\r\nIntermediate or experienced level professionals rarely ever list their GPA on their resume because they have other achievements and work experience to highlight.\r\nIf you\'re a recent college grad, you should add your GPA to the top of your resume.\r\nBut keep in mind having a competitive grade point average alone isn\'t enough to get your resume noticed.\r\nAs a new grad, most of your accomplishments up to this point will revolve around school, so naturally, you\'ll want to use a strong GPA to your advantage.\r\nJust keep in mind that a competitive grade point average alone won\'t get your resume to the top of the interview pile.\r\nYou\'ll also want to include the following:<br>\r\n- A professional-sounding email address (hotgirl99@gmail won\'t cut it)<br>\r\n- Relevant skills and any activities and accomplishments that help you stand out<br>\r\n- Volunteer experience (spelled out using action verbs)<br>\r\n- A strong professional summary that overshadows your lack of work experience<br>\r\nRecruiters also suggest finding ways to link your GPA to other accomplishments.\r\nReference letters from people who can vouch for your character and leadership abilities can be especially helpful here.\r\n<h3><strong>What if my college GPA is lower than 3.0?</strong></h3>\r\nThe only time you should avoid listing your GPA on your first after-graduation resume is if it\'s lower than a 3.0.\r\nFor some fields, this cut-off may be 3.3.\r\nIf your GPA isn\'t quite where you need it to be, there are certain steps you can take during job searches.\r\nFor example, include your major GPA on your resume instead of your cumulative GPA.\r\nThink about it: what\'s a 3.3 GPA? This is just above a B average.\r\nIn the eyes of most recruiters, this is enough to show that you challenged yourself with tougher classes in college yet still managed to keep relatively high grades throughout.\r\nA GPA that is lower than this draws attention to the fact that you averaged a B or lower in most, if not all, of your classes.\r\nThis might send a signal that you weren\'t as dedicated to your college career as you should have been.\r\nBut thankfully, this isn\'t the end of the world. There are steps that you can take to make sure your grades don\'t hinder your job search.\r\nThese include:<br>\r\n- Including the GPA of classes related to your major instead of overall GPA<br>\r\n- Leaving your GPA off of your resume/application unless asked for<br>\r\n- Preparing a solid explanation to use during future interviews when asked about your GPA<br>\r\nThe last suggest can be especially helpful if you struggled early on in school but then picked things up.\r\nFor example, you might explain during an interview that your most recent four semesters are evidence of your actual academic abilities.\r\nIn this case, be sure to be fully upfront and honest, but avoid sounding defensive.\r\n<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>\r\nAfter you score your first job, you\'ll be able to rely less on your GPA.\r\nUntil then, employers will probably be considering it as a way to assess your ability to perform well.\r\nIf you have a high GPA, you\'re on the right track!\r\nHighlight it in the education section of your resume and use it as a strong point during your interview.\r\nIf your grade point average isn\'t what you would like it to be, that doesn\'t have to be a dealbreaker.\r\nJust make sure that you take responsibility and highlight what you can do well versus what you\'ve struggled with (wins over losses).', 'Learn how your GPA affects your job hunt and what to do if it’s lower than 3.0.', 'blog-first-jobs.jpg', 'GPAGenie Team', '2024-01-18 11:45:00', 357, 19),
(5, 'Are Your Grades Confidential?', 'grades-confidential', 'As a student, the privacy of your grades is protected by FERPA. We\'ll walk through what these regulations are, what they cover, and how they work.\r\nYour grades are more than just a letter or number stored in a teacher\'s grade book. In fact, grades are official documents recognized by the highest level of the law in the US.\r\nLong gone are the days when a teacher might post\r\na list of grades outside the classroom door or announce who passed or failed out loud during class.\r\nAs a student, you have a right to privacy and to determine what personal information is shared by your school and who is allowed access. If you attend a publicly funded college, your school\'s administration and staff are held to particularly high standards regarding student records.\r\nKnowing what information can be shared about your grades, and who has access, is important no matter what level of student you are.\r\nThe most important regulation protecting your information is known as FERPA.\r\nHere, we\'ll answer the question \"what is FERPA?\", provide insight into its requirements, and discuss how you can find more information on grade confidentiality.\r\n<h3><strong>What is FERPA?</strong></h3>\r\nThe Family Educational Privacy Act (FERPA), sometimes called the Buckley Amendment, is the law that protects student information.\r\nAny record that a school maintains on a student is protected under this law.\r\nYour test grades, GPA, and standardized testing scores all fall under the umbrella of FERPA, leading them to be classified as private information that cannot be released to others unless you give consent.\r\n<h3><strong>What Information can be Released?</strong></h3>\r\nThere are two main types of information that educators have access to: directory information and personally identifiable information.\r\nDirectory information is not protected by FERPA and includes:<br>\r\n- Name, address, telephone number<br>\r\n- Dates of attendance, major, enrollment status<br>\r\n- Degrees, honors, and awards received<br>\r\nThis information isn\'t protected by FERPA as it\'s not generally considered an invasion of privacy or harmful to have these details shared.\r\nPersonally identifiable information, on the other hand, is information that can be traced to your identity. This information is protected.\r\nAlthough FERPA does not consider directory info as \'protected\' like grades, GPA, academic transcripts, and disciplinary records, it does give you the right to \"opt-out\" of sharing this information if you would like to do so.\r\n<h3><strong>Do all Schools have to follow FERPA?</strong></h3>\r\nNot every school is subject to federal confidentiality laws when it comes to grades.\r\nFERPA only covers any public or private school that receives federal funding of any kind.\r\nThese schools are required to follow special privacy laws that apply to both written and computerized student records.\r\nAdditionally, many states have their own privacy laws that work alongside FERPA.\r\nGenerally speaking, these laws require all information to be kept confidential.\r\nThe big exception here is if you give written permission to have your information shared with someone.\r\nIf you are at all concerned about the privacy of your grades or personal information, you might consider doing some research on your specific state laws.\r\nYour school resource center should have this information on hand for you.\r\n<h3><strong>Do my Parents have the Right to See my Grades?</strong></h3>\r\nIf you\'re a minor, no special consent is needed for your parents to view your grades.\r\nThey can access your information without needing your permission.\r\nHowever, students who are 18 years or older and are attending college have more say in who has access to their information.\r\nIn most cases, you must give written consent for the release of grades and other data before your parents can gain access.\r\nThis is important to know, especially if you are wanting to gain autonomy or a stronger sense of privacy.\r\n<h3><strong>Who Else has the Right to Access my Grades?</strong></h3>\r\nEducators are never allowed to release grade information to other students or those who do not have your consent.\r\nFERPA only allows students, parents, and educationally interested school officials access to private records.\r\nIn general, the following can fall under this umbrella:<br>\r\n- Teachers/instructors<br>\r\n- School administrators<br>\r\n- Health staff/counselors<br>\r\n- School attorneys\r\nAnd again, in many cases, your consent must be given before access is given.\r\n<h3><strong>What Other Rights do I have under FERPA?</strong></h3>\r\nThere are a handful of reasons you or others may need to access your school records.\r\nFor example, students and parents of minors are able to review records for accuracy and checking that all information is up-to-date.\r\nEach education agency is required to send a notification out annually with instructions and information notifying recipients of their rights under the policy.\r\nThis notification often also contains detailed information regarding how to amend inaccurate records.\r\n<h3><strong>Exceptions to Student Record Privacy Laws</strong></h3>\r\nIn some special cases, schools may be allowed to release student records without express permission.\r\nFor example, let\'s say you are planning on transferring to another university.\r\nIn order to be accepted, the college admissions department would need access to your transcript and other information.\r\nAuthorized legal officials with a subpoena can also bypass FERPA.\r\nFrom time to time, the school district may also perform audits on student performance that require this information, as well.\r\nAnd once again, parents of adult students are allowed access to student records, but only if they have received written consent from the student.\r\n<h3><strong>Learning More About your Privacy Rights</strong></h3>\r\nYou have a right to privacy and to decide who has access to your information including your grades.\r\nIf you wish to learn more about your privacy rights under FERPA, your school is required to provide you with additional information.\r\nIn many cases, your headmaster or school principal is an excellent point of contact you can connect with to obtain this knowledge.\r\nYour school advisor is another person that you can turn to with questions about student record protection.\r\nYou can also access more information online at the Department of Education\'s official website.', 'Your grades are legally protected under FERPA.

(6, 'What are Latin Honors?', 'latin-honors', 'Latin honors are awarded to high-performing college graduates. These are the levels of Latin honors and some tips on how to best achieve each one.\r\n<h3><strong>The Honor System</strong></h3>\r\nLatin honors are highly coveted graduation distinctions that mark tremendous academic achievement. Colleges and universities mainly accredit them, but some U.S. high schools also offer Latin Honors. According to the American Military University, Latin Honor designation falls\r\ninto three categories, each with its own minimum GPA requirement. These include:<br>\r\n- Summa cum laude<br>\r\n- Magna cum laude<br>\r\n- Cum laude<br>\r\nSumma cum laude is awarded to an elite group of the most senior performing students in the class. Magna cum laude is granted to the next level, and finally, cum laude comprises the final tier of highly successful students.\r\nThe three Latin honors are summa cum laude, magna cum laude and cum laude.\r\n<h3><strong>Summa Cum Laude Meaning</strong></h3>\r\nSumma cum laude is a prestigious title awarded to students with \"the highest distinction\".\r\nTypically, this distinction is given to graduates whose grades place them in the highest percentage of their school.\r\nIn some cases, another metric, such as class rank or number of hours completed, can also put students in this category.\r\n<h3><strong>Magna Cum Laude Meaning</strong></h3>\r\nMagna cum laude signifies a degree earned \"with great distinction.\"\r\nThis level of Latin honor is awarded to those who achieve a strong GPA, but don\'t meet the minimum requirements of summa cum laude.\r\nIt is the middle tier between summa cum laude and cum laude.\r\n<h3><strong>Cum Laude Meaning</strong></h3>\r\nCum laude may be the lowest rank of Latin honors, but it is still a great achievement.\r\nThis distinction is bestowed upon students graduating \"with distinction\" or \"with honor.\"\r\n<h3><strong>Latin Honors Milestones</strong></h3>\r\nThe milestones required to achieve each level of distinction depend on the colleges and universities setting them.\r\nMost frequently, these requirements include a minimum GPA, class rank, hours completed, and faculty recommendations.\r\nSome institutions prefer success in all of these areas, while others base their decision off of only one or two of them.\r\nWhile online resources are a great place to start, it is important to visit your university website or reach out to your school\'s guidance office directly.\r\nDoing so will ensure that you are working toward the correct cum laude, summa cum laude, and magna cum laude requirements.\r\n<h3><strong>Summa Cum Laude Requirements</strong></h3>\r\nThe most significant distinction, summa cum laude, is usually reserved for the smallest group of students graduating with a Bachelor\'s degree.\r\nThe conditions are so rigorous that in some cases, only a few students out of the entire class receive the honor.\r\nStudents can expect to need to graduate in the top 5% of their class and might need to complete at least ninety quarter hours.\r\nIn order to achieve summa cum laude, GPA will need to be 3.90 or higher.\r\nA thesis and instructor recommendation might also be required.\r\n<h3><strong>Magna Cum Laude Requirements</strong></h3>\r\nMagna cum laude requirements can differ based on the institution and even the program within the institution.\r\nMost commonly, it is awarded to those who achieve a minimum GPA of 3.70.\r\nMuch of the time, students must graduate in the top 10% of their class and complete 90 credit hours.\r\nAlong with these criteria, non-GPA factors such as completion of a certain number of advanced courses also are considered.\r\n<h3><strong>Cum Laude Requirements</strong></h3>\r\nThe final class merit is cum laude.\r\nStudents who wish to graduate under this category should score at least a 3.50 GPA and graduate in the top 25% of their class.\r\nMany colleges and universities only consider a student\'s GPA for cum laude status.\r\nStill, other academic records and achievements may also be included, depending on the school.\r\n<h3><strong>How to Achieve Latin Honors</strong></h3>\r\nAchieving Latin honors is no small feat.\r\nSumma cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude all require commitment and keeping your eyes on the prize.\r\nHere are a few tips to use on your journey to graduate with distinction.\r\n<h4><strong>Ask for Help</strong></h4>\r\nIf you are hoping to achieve Latin honors with your diploma, you don\'t have to do it alone.\r\nYour school likely has a guidance counselor whose job is to help you reach your goals.\r\nIf you are wanting to earn cum laude, sum laude, or magna cum laude, consider connecting with this person.\r\nThen, you can devise a plan and set short-term goals to help you reach your full potential.\r\nWhat GPA will you need to reach every semester to receive Latin Honors?\r\nBreaking your goal down into smaller, more manageable targets is often the first step.\r\n<h4><strong>Stay Balanced</strong></h4>\r\nFinding equilibrium is important for any student, high school or otherwise.\r\nYou may choose to take on a massive load of advanced classes to beef up your academic record.\r\nThis sounds like a good plan in theory, but it can get overwhelming fast.\r\nIt is vital to balance complex courses with easier ones.\r\nYou will still complete your required hours, but in classes that you\'re sure to score high in. Again, speaking to a guidance counselor can help you determine how to reach this goal.\r\n<h4><strong>Improve Organization and Study Skills</strong></h4>\r\nStudying is the most critical part of making sure you get the best grade possible.\r\nCreating a study environment that works for you will make a big difference.\r\nConsider finding somewhere quiet and secluded where you can focus free of distractions.\r\nThis way, you can direct all your attention on the task at hand.\r\nHonors students must also practice good time management skills. Try recording due dates and test days in a calendar or daily planner so that you have everything you need in one place.\r\n<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>\r\nCum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude are all prestigious titles that can help you stand out from other students at both a high school and university level.\r\nIf you are interested in working toward these distinctions, reach out to a guidance counselor for school specifics and set specific goals.\r\nDoing so will allow you to earn Latin honors in the semesters to come.', 'Graduating with honors?
